Studies have revealed that the demand for Machine Learning skills is on the rise. As a result, more and more people are looking for ways to hone their ML skillset. Since mastering anything requires continuous engagement, we have built a Google Chrome extension called *GraspML* that helps enthusiasts in keeping up with various Machine Learning concepts. Each time someone opens a new tab in Google Chrome, this extension generates a flash card containing a brief description of a random ML concept with links to related ML concepts and good quality resources for further readings. This way enthusiasts can continuously improve their grasp of various ML concepts.
